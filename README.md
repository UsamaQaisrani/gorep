# gorep

A simple implementation of Linux's `grep` command written in Go.

This project is part of my journey learning Go and exploring how regular expression (regex) engines work under the hood.  
It searches for simple patterns in text files or standard input, similar to the classic `grep` tool in Linux.

Still working on it!.
